FUNCTIONS AND MACROS

(field N)

        Get the contents of the N-th field. Counting starts at 1. Field
        0 is the whole line. Counting from the right is possible as
        well; the rightmost/last item in the fields list is -1, the
        item before that is -2, etc.

$N

        Shorthand for (field N). Due to the limitations of the reader,
        only numbers are allowed, and $nf. In other words, N cannot be
        a more complex expression; in that case, use 'field' instead.
