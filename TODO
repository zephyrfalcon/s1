# TODO

- Read input from files if specified (currently only stdin is supported).

- There seems to be a bug when used with ack. Rather vague at the
  moment; when piped through s1, we don't get quite as many results as
  without it. Not sure why; there might be bogus characters (e.g. EOF)
  in the data returned by ack.
