# TODO

- Read input from files if specified (currently only stdin is supported).

- Keep separate line counter for each file being read, and maybe for
  the number of each file.

- Check if FORMAT is adequate for formatting floating point numbers
  etc, or that we need an easier/shorter way to do this.
