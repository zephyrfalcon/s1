# TODO

- Read input from files if specified (currently only stdin is supported).

- Keep separate line counter for each file being read, and maybe for
  the number of each file.

- Check if FORMAT is adequate for formatting floating point numbers
  etc, or that we need an easier/shorter way to do this.

- There seems to be a bug when used with ack. Rather vague at the
  moment; when piped through s1, we don't get quite as many results as
  without it. Not sure why; there might be bogus characters (e.g. EOF)
  in the data returned by ack.
