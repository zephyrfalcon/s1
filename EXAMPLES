(Examples assume input from stdin, and output to stdout, unless
specified otherwise.)

1. Double-space a file:

  s1 -e '(out $0) (out "")'

2. Remove empty lines:

  s1 -e '(? $0 (out $0))'

3. Double-space a file which already has blank lines in it. Output
file should contain no more than one blank line between lines of text.

  s1 -e '(? $0 (out $0) (out ""))'

4. Display lines with the line number in front:

  s1 -e '(out ln "\t" $0)'

5. Only number non-blank lines in a file:

  s1 -e '(before (def c)) (? $0 (inc! c)) (? $0 (out c "\t" $0) (out $0))'
  # TODO: should be MUCH shorter!

6. Count the number of lines in a file:

  s1 -e '(after (out nl))'
