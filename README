This is s1, an Awk-like tool for scripting, written in Scheme.

Much like Awk, s1 can be used for quick manipulation of text, or
throwaway scripts. Instead of providing a new language to do this, s1
uses Scheme (Gauche Scheme, to be precise), enhanced with a number of
functions and macros for commonly used tasks.

REQUIREMENTS

- Gauche 0.9 [http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/]

- Unix-like system with a shell like bash, or similar. (On Windows,
  Cygwin would probably work, but this is untested.)

INSTALLATION

- Gauche Scheme must be installed. More precisely, the 'gosh' shell
  must be available on the command line.

- Grab the s1 source from git:

  $ git clone git://github.com/zephyrfalcon/s1.git

- Put the resulting 's1' directory somewhere. For example, mine is in
  ~/projects/github/s1.

- For easy access, make an alias in your shell:

  $ alias s1='gosh ~/projects/github/s1/s1.scm'

  (using the actual path where you installed s1, of course). It is
  recommended that you put this alias in your ~/.profile.

USAGE

Assuming the aforementioned alias has been defined, s1 is called like:

  s1 [options] [files...]

If no options or files are specified, s1 functions as a pipe, passing
input from stdin unchanged to stdout. For example, `ls | s1` simply
shows the contents of ls.
